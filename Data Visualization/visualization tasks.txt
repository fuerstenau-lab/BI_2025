Choose a dataset you want to work with. You can you use the Iris dataset,
the dataset of your BI project or any other available dataset.
Some ccol examples can be found here:

Here are some challenges for you:

Initial Inspection

1)Identify the types of features.
	Create a summary of which features are numeric, categorical, datetime, or textual.
	Challenge: How do you handle columns that look numeric but are actually IDs or categories?
	
2) Create at least one appropriate plot to summarize each type.
	For numeric: distributions (histogram, KDE, boxplot, etc.)
	For categorical: bar plots, count plots, pie charts (only if <5 categories)
	Challenge: Don't just plot everything. Choose plots based on the featureâ€™s cardinality and explain your choice.



Visualize Relationships

3) Explore pairwise relationships between numeric features.
	Create a correlation heatmap or scatterplot matrix.
	Highlight non-obvious correlations or suspiciously high ones.
	Challenge: Point out multicollinearity or unexpected linear relationships.

4) Explore the relationship between numeric and categorical features.
	Use grouped boxplots, violin plots, or swarm plots.
	Challenge: Choose at least one categorical feature and explain how the numeric distribution changes across its levels. Are there clear separations?

5) Choose a pair of features and create at least two different visualizations to show their relationship.
	Challenge: Which visualization gives the clearest insight? Explain why one chart tells the story better than the other.



Outliers, Imbalance, and the Unexpected

6) Detect and visualize outliers.
	Use boxplots, scatterplots, or quantile plots.
	Challenge: Explain whether the outliers might be errors, rare cases, or key discoveries.

7) Check for class imbalance or rare category values.
	Challenge: Create a visualization that highlights extreme imbalance without flattening the rest (e.g., log scale bar plots, broken axes, annotations).

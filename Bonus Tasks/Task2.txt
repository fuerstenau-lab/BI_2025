Bonus Task 2

The scond part of the bonus tasks is to connect a dashboard to your data ware house from the first part.

Your task is to submit jupyter notebook that creates a standardized visualization of relevant data in your data warehouse.
It is your decision how to implement the visualization:
	- You can implement function that create simple plots in your terminal. See e.g.:
		https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/guides/data_viewers/youplot.html
	- Or you can connect your data ware house to an actual dashboard library, such as plotly dash. Here some ideas for resources

Please come up with an extension to your data warehouse that visualizates data in two different ways.
Here are a few ideas:
	- Identify the most resource-intensive cost centers
	- Show the proportion of budget that remains available across all funds
	- Visualize how staff are distributed across projects or departments
	- Monitor spending over time to detect patterns
	- Track budget, expenses, and available funds per fund across 2023â€“2025

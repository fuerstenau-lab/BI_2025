Bonus Task 1

Your task is to create a data ware house for the expenses of a university research group.
In our GitHub Repository you will find a number of data files:
1) Annual Fund Overviews: These files hold informaiton about the funds that were active each year.
2) Expense Overviews: These files are assigned one fund and contain information over the actual expenses that were covered by their assigned fund.
3) Personal Overview: This file shows who was employed in this research group.

You have the following tasks:
- Read and clean the data files in a jupyter notbook.
- Set up a duckDB data warehouse in a star schema. 
	The Fact Table should hold relevant information about expenses (e.g. fund_id, date, value, category, description)
- Add at least one dimensional table 


How to start?
1) Explore the Data
	Inspect and understand the structure of each file:
	What columns exist?
	What do they represent?
2) Design the Star Schema
	Identify the fact table(s): Where can you find transactional data?
	Identify useful dimension tables: E.g. time, personals, projects.
3) Create the Tables in DuckDB
4) Clean and transform the data
	Make sure that categories you want to use exist in your tables!
5) Populate the Warehouse
6) Run a few analytical queries to see if it works
	Total spend by year or project
	Projects with highest personnel costs
